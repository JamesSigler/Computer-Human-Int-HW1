Theres's nothing dangerously wrong with this panel but there are some small things such as the Ground floor
button does not line up with the other which makes it slightly harder to look at and use, especially for someone who is visually impaired.

Lights also do not stay on when they are pressed so it is hard to tell which floors are selected.

There is no audio functionallity to this elevator.

Emergency buttons are harder to reach and/or located at the bottom of the interface.
