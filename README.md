Theres's nothing dangerously wrong with this panel but there are some small things such as the Ground floor
button does not line up with the other which makes it slightly harder to look at and use, especially for someone who is visually impaired.

Lights also do not stay on when they are pressed so it is hard to tell which floors are selected.

There is no audio functionallity to this elevator. Someone who is blind may miss their floor or not know if they chose the wrong floor.
There was actually no indicator for the floor anyway in this elevator.

Emergency buttons are harder to reach and/or located at the bottom of the interface. 
EX: Someone with physical medical problems such as back problems who can't bend down during emergencies.

A minor problem is the emergency buttons not being covered. Since they are both low and uncovered children can play with them. 
This can also happen on accident for many other reasons.

### Part B:
Common Uses: Travelling between floors.
Rarer Uses: Raising an alarm when nesessary or calling for help when nessesary.

This elevator's interface makes the most common interactions easier and is useable as is.

Common Sequence:
Press the call button
Wait
Doors open
Enter
Inspect panel
Push floor button
Wait
Doors open
Exit

Elevators usually have a certain standard that they follow. Having pictures, icons, and instructions help the interface even more usable.

Elevators usually show feedback with audio, pictures, lights and visual queues.

Based on the sketch:
I lined up all of the buttons on one row with the braille to the right slightly off the panel. I did this to add more room and clean up the alignment of other buttons. 

I brought the emergency and alarm buttons up and covered them with a sliding panel for when they are nessesary. 

I also added a panel to dislay the current floor.

I moved the open and close buttons to the other side to keep the buttons with different functions seperate.

Lasty, I added addition interface information such as time and date. The welcome at the top would be a panel that could scroll for the user to view.

### Part A:

I would say that the panel would have a 1:2 ration length and width. Around 12x24 inches so that it is not overly large.
