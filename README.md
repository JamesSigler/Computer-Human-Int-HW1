Theres's nothing dangerously wrong with this panel but there are some small things such as the Ground floor
button does not line up with the other which makes it slightly harder to look at and use, especially for someone who is visually impaired.

Lights also do not stay on when they are pressed so it is hard to tell which floors are selected.

There is no audio functionallity to this elevator. Someone who is blind may miss their floor or not know if they chose the wrong floor.
There was actually no indicator for the floor anyway in this elevator.

Emergency buttons are harder to reach and/or located at the bottom of the interface. 
EX: Someone with physical medical problems such as back problems who can't bend down during emergencies.

A minor problem is emergency buttons not being covered. Since they are both low and uncovered children can play with them. 
This can also happen on accident for many other reasons.
